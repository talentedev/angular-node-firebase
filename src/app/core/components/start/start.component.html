    <h2>How Does AllGive Work?</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Create Your Account</h3>
    <p>Just tell us your email address and we'll send you an activation link to get started. There are no passwords to remember and you can get started right away.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Choose a Charity</h3>
    <p>Visit our ever-growing list of charitable organizations and select the one to which you want to make a regular contribution. Simply click the "Donate" button and AllGive will allow you to choose how much you'd like to contribute and how often. Our system will handle the rest.</p>
    <p>That's all there is to it! You can choose how frequently you'd like emailed reports on your giving, and you can always see how your donations are making a difference by visiting your <span *ngIf="isAuthenticated() == false">personal Dashboard page</span><a *ngIf="isAuthenticated()" routerLink="/user/dashboard">personal Dashboard page</a>.</p>
